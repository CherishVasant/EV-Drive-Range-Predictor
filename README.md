# ðŸ”‹ Electric Vehicle Range Prediction using Machine Learning ðŸš—ðŸ“Š

This project uses various Machine Learning models to predict the **range of Electric Vehicles (EVs)** based on input features like battery capacity, vehicle weight, and other technical specifications.


---

## ðŸš€ Objectives

- Apply and compare multiple **regression algorithms** for EV range prediction.
- Use **GridSearchCV** for **hyperparameter tuning** ðŸ§ª.
- Evaluate model performance using **RÂ² Score** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** ðŸ“‰.
- Visualize results using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.

---

## ðŸ§  Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor
- K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor

All models are fine-tuned and evaluated on a separate **test set**.

---

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics

Each model is evaluated using:

- **RÂ² Score** (`r2_score`) ðŸ“ˆ
- **Mean Absolute Error** (`mean_absolute_error`) ðŸ“‰

Final evaluation is stored and printed for comparison.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


How to Run
- Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/EV-ML-Range-Predictor.git

- Navigate to the folder:
cd EV-ML-Range-Predictor
